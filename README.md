## 📌 Overview

This project presents a **Content-Based Recommendation System** designed to elevate the shopping experience on e-commerce platforms. By analyzing product metadata like **titles**, **descriptions**, and **categories**, it intelligently recommends items aligned with user interests — **without relying on past ratings or purchase history**.

> ✅ Built for cold-start problems  
> ⚡ Powered by TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity  
> 💡 Provides smart, real-time recommendations
